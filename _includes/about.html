                    <p class="large text-muted">I moved to England during my gap year and after seven month of learning to perfect the perfect flat white I decided I needed to pursue a different challenge. I always had an interest for development, so decided to enrol in the General Assembly Web Development Immersive course to complete my previous experience in Information Architecture and User Experience. I now find myself a budding developer, with a fair amount of google-fu knowledge under my belt, two web app already deployed and a much better understanding of how much distance a good User Experience-er needs to bridge the gap between user needs and coding abilities. This being said my learning curve is just at the beginning, and I hope to further my self-education under Agile wings and senior colleagues.</p>
